Car Price Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of cars based on various features using linear regression. The dataset used for this project contains information about different cars, including their make, model, mileage, engine size, and other relevant attributes.



Requirements
Python 
Pandas
Seaborn
Scikit-learn 
Matplotlib 



Installation
To install the required packages, you can use the following command:

cd car_price_prediction
Run the car_price_prediction.py script:
bash
Copy code
python car_price_prediction.py



Results
After running the car_price_prediction.py script, the model will be trained on the dataset, and predictions will be made for car prices based on the input features. Evaluation metrics mean absolute percentage error will be displayed to assess the performance of the linear regression model.
