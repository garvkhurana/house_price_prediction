python house_price_prediction.py



Results
After running the house_prize_prediction.py script, the model will be trained on the dataset, and predictions will be made for car prices based on the input features. Evaluation metrics mean absolute percentage error will be displayed to assess the performance of the linear regression model.


Deployment on the golobal host
I have deployed this projct also using RENDER CLOUD PLATFORM 
here's the link to access (on my mother's name) https://pooja-khurana.onrender.com (the link cannot be accessed as I have suspended the services form behind).
Here I have also made a procfile to upload it on render

It took me around 10-15 minutes to build and develop that website on the cloud
